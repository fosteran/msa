									<p><img src="images/hospital.jpg" class="left"> <strong>3rd Year, Summer:</strong> There will be a third year orientation in mid June. The 1st block of <a href="http://student.medicine.iu.edu/StudentRecords/Calendars/MSIIICal1112.htm">rotations</a> will begin. Over the course of the year, 3rd years will complete three blocks: Pediatrics/Family Medicine/Vacation, Surgery/OB/Sub-specialty, and Medicine/Neurology/Psychiatry. A written NBME Subject Exam will be given at the end of each clerkship. Letters of recommendation for your residency application should be obtained throughout the year.</p>
								<p> <strong>3rd Year, Fall:</strong> The second block of rotations is complete by early February. Spend time with your family over the short Thanksgiving and Holiday breaks, and continue working to discover what specialty is right for you. Keep exploring the Careers in Medicine website, which has tools to assess your compatibility with different <a href="http://www.aamc.org/students/cim/specialties.htm">specialities</a>.</p>
								<p> <strong>3rd Year, Spring:</strong> The final block of clinical rotations lasts from February to mid-May. Early on, meet with advisors and attend the residency fair to learn about available specialities and plan your 4th year. The 4th year schedule will consist of 3 months of <a href="http://student.medicine.iu.edu/StudentRecords/Calendars/MSIIICal1112.htm">core rotations</a> in radiology, emergency medicine, and an internal medicine sub-internship. The sub-l rotation provides rigorous clinical exposure that will resemble your time as an intern in the future. The schedule is very flexible, with the remaining 9 months containing vacation months and your choice from about <a href="http://msa.iusm.iu.edu/StudentRecords/ElectivesBook/ElectivesOverview20112012.htm">370 electives</a>. Continue narrowing your speciality choice.</p>

									<p><img src="images/reviewing-with-doctor.jpg" class="left"> Residency programs will vary by the location and area of concentration. In your first year, as an intern, you will forfeit personal time in exchange for a greater responsibility to patients. As a resident, you will be in charge of the interns and medical students on your team, and responsible for the work they do. A residency can last between 3 and 5+ years, and can be followed by a fellowship for some specialties. After meeting specific requirements and passing the <a href="http://www.usmle.org/Examinations/step3/step3.html">USMLE Step 3</a> exam, which tests your ability to assess clinical cases and manage patients in an unsupervised setting, you will be eligible for your medical license. Enjoy your career as a successful physician!</p>
